    "# WeRateDogs - Data Wrangling & Analyzing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downloaded the csv file 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv' provided by Udacity.\n",
    "- Created a twitter developer account to obtain access to tweets count of retweets and count of favorites.\n",
    "- Downloaded image prediction file hosted on https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Gathered Data consists of below dataframes -\n",
    "1. archive_df - This dataframe contains details of all the tweets.\n",
    "2. tweets_info_df - This dataframe contains tweet_id, number of retweets, and number of favorites for each tweet. The data is downloaded using Twitter API\n",
    "3. image_prediction_df - This dataframe contains information about predictions of the image. It is downloaded from the URL provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assess Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset was explored to assess the missing values, duplicate rows, incorrect datatypes, and any other issues. Both qualitative and tidiness assessment was carried out on all the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality assessment of archive_df dataframe -\n",
    "1. There are missing values in columns - in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id , retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp, expanded_urls\n",
    "2. rating_numerator and rating_denominator has inconsistent values.\n",
    "3. One of the tweet (tweet_id = 835246439529840640) has denominator rating of 0\n",
    "4. Dog names consists of filler words like 'a', 'actually', 'all', 'an', 'by', 'getting','his', 'incredibly', 'infuriating', 'just', 'life', 'light', 'mad', 'my', 'not', 'officially', 'old', 'one', 'quite', 'space', 'such', 'the', 'this', 'unacceptable', 'very'\n",
    "5. Datatype of timestamp and retweeted_status_timestamp should be DateTime. It is currently string.\n",
    "6. Datatypes of in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id must be integer. It is currently float.\n",
    "7. In columns doggo, floofer, pupper , puppo, there are some missing values represented by None.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidiness assessment of archive_df dataframe -\n",
    "1. Some attributes like Number of Favorites and Number of Retweet are in seperate dataframe. It should be merged in this dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality assessment of tweets_info dataframe -\n",
    "1. Information for 25 tweets is not available when downloaded from twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidiness assessment of tweets_info dataframe -\n",
    "1. Attributes like Number of Favorites and Number of Retweet in this dataframe should be merged with archive_df dataframe which has other attributes of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality and tidiness assessment of image_predictions_df dataframe -\n",
    "1. Data is clean with no missing values.\n",
    "2. Predictions are available for only for 2075 tweets.\n",
    "3. Prediction output will be merged with archive_df dataframe so that all the details are captured in a single dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was cleaned using the Define-Code-Test approach.\n",
    "Following steps performed - \n",
    "1. Creating a copy of original dataframes so that original is preserved.\n",
    "2. Convert datatype of tweet_id in all dataframes to string.\n",
    "3. Merge attributes from tweets_clean and img_pred_clean in archive_clean by using a inner join with tweet_id as unique key.\n",
    "4. Convert different dog categories (doggo, floffer, pupper, puppo) into one column\n",
    "5. Convert following columns into string - in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id , retweeted_status_user_id\n",
    "6. Convert following columns into datetime - retweeted_status_timestamp, timestamp\n",
    "7. Dog names consists of filler words like 'a', 'actually', 'all', 'an', 'by', 'getting','his', 'incredibly', 'infuriating', 'just', 'life', 'light', 'mad', 'my', 'not', 'officially', 'old', 'one', 'quite', 'space', 'such', 'the', 'this', 'unacceptable', 'very'. Change these names to 'None'.\n",
    "8. Column retweeted_status_timestamp has missing values. However, the variable is not too important. Hence, dropping the said column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Store Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored the final clean dataframe into a CSV file 'twitter_archive_master.csv'. The dataset has 2046 rows and 26 columns."
